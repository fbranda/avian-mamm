# AVIAN-MAMM: A Global Open Access Dataset of Reported Avian Flu Events in Mammals


## About this repository <a name="AboutthisRepository"></a>

This is the public repository of the AVIAN-MAMM Dataset and related
documentation. <br>

This repository contains: <br>

**<code>latest-outbreaks-mammals.csv</code>**: This file contains the **raw data**
of the AVIAN-MAMM Dataset, reporting the latest information available on
avian flu events in animals. <br>

**<code>avian-mamm-visualization.Rmd</code>**: This Markdown file contains
the **code** to explore, describe, and visualize the dataset. <br>

**<code>Contributing.md</code>**: This file provides guidelines for
contributing to the project: suggesting changes to the data or to the
code, submitting new data, and contributing to the code.<br>

**<code>avian-mamm-PDF-archives</code>**: For each avian flu event
recorded in the dataset, a copy of the report used as primary information source is saved in this folder. 
Each report was downloaded as a .pdf file. <br>  

**<code>sequences</code>**: Genetic sequences made available by APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories from the U.S. influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, recently found in samples associated with the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in poultry and wild birds and the recent H5N1 event in dairy cattle.

The [AVIAN-MAMM Map](https://tinyurl.com/avianflu-mammals-map) provides
interactive visualizations of the dynamic version of the dataset. <br>

## About the Data <a name="Data"></a>

### Data sources

Information has been collected from the World Animal Health Information
System [WAHIS](https://wahis.woah.org/) of the World Organisation for
Animal Health ([WOAH](https://wahis.woah.org/#/home), formerly OIE).
<br>

[WAHIS](https://wahis.woah.org/) is a Web-based computer system that
processes data on animal diseases in real-time. WAHIS data reflects the
information gathered by the Veterinary Services from WOAH Members and
non-Members Countries and Territories on WOAH-listed diseases in
domestic animals and wildlife, as well as on emerging and zoonotic
diseases. The detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in animals meets
the criteria for reporting to the World Animal Health Organisation
(WOAH) as an emerging infection in accordance with the WOAH Terrestrial
Animal Health Code. Only authorized users, i.e.Â the Delegates of WOAH
Member Countries and their authorised representatives, can enter data
into the WAHIS platform to notify the WOAH of relevant animal disease
information. All information are publicly accessible on the
[WAHIS](https://wahis.woah.org/#/events) interface. <br>
<br>

### Data collection process

Data on each avian flu event in mammals was collected and entered
manually in a .csv file. <br>

#### Note

We have considered the two following values throughout the dataset: <br>

-   <code>NA</code> Not available: the information would be relevant for
    the event but the information was not mentioned in the WAHIS report. <br>
